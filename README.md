# Grocery-App
Existing grocery list applications abound, but due to their complex user interfaces, none of them attract sufficient organic traffic. These apps are used by people of all ages, so the user interface needs to be very simple and basic. Users download these apps for ease, thus we shouldn't add too many security layers since we know that convenience is sacrificed for security.

MVVM (Model View ViewModel) architectural principles, Room for the database, and RecyclerView to display the list of items are all used in this project. Let's define these terms first before moving on to the project.

# MVVM (Model View ViewModel)
Android uses MVVM architecture to arrange project code and make it simpler to understand. An architectural design pattern used in Android is MVVM. XML files and Activity classes are treated as Views by MVVM. With this design approach, UI and logic are entirely separated. Here is a visual representation of MVVM.

# Room DataBase
The data of apps, such as grocery item name, grocery item quantity, and grocery item price, are stored using the database management library known as Room Persistence Library. Room is a cover layer for SQLite that facilitates simple database operations.

# RecyclerView
RecyclerView is a container that is used to show a collection of data in a sizable data set that can be scrolled efficiently by keeping the number of views to a minimum.
## Adapter
An adapter handles the data that goes inside a RecyclerView. It provides a binding from an app-specific data set to views displayed within RecyclerView.
